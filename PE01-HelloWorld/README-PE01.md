The following folder will showcasee understanding of creating an application
By using the Expo Client via Codespaces

The input is:
1. npm install -g expo-cli
2. npx expo start
3. expo init HelloWorld
4. cd HelloWorld
5. npm run ios (I used ios because I have an iPhone)
6. I changed the text in the App,js file to match what is asked in PE01
7. Then I changed the background color to yellow

The process is installing the expo client globally. This was done because it allowed me to access the expo application to my phone. The 
second through fifth steps are setting up the Expo Application for utilization. As I make changes or errors while connected to the Metro tunnel, I am able to see the changes happen automatically. The final two steps of the process are adding the necessary text and background color per the assignment.

The result is in the PE01.png file found in this directory

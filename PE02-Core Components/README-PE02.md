The following folder will showcasee understanding of creating an application
By using the Expo Client via Codespaces
The input has two parts: initializing the web application and settingup the App.js file

-- Initializing Web Application
The input is:
1. mkdir "PE02-Core Components
2. cd "PE02-Core Components
3. mkdir PE02
4. cd PE02
5. npm install -g expo-cli
6. npx expo start
7. expo init PE02
8. cd PE02
9. npm run ios (I used ios because I have an iPhone)

-- Setting up the App.js
1. Import the required packages (React, TextInput, ScrollView, Text, and Image)
2. Import the image that you will be using from the assets folder
3. In the Image component, use source = {Icon} as that is what we defined the image's pathway to be
4. Use View + each component along with the style function to help create the application
5. Ensure that each of the changes are occurring in the Expo application 

-- Output
A screenshot of the output can be efound in the PE02-Core Components folder
